	<h3>Course Description</h3>

	<p>The curriculum for this course is flexible. Jack and I intend to be responsive to your programming interests and desires. To address these desires, we will make an effort to learn about your jobs, career aspirations, and hobbies. </p>

	<p>At the beginning of the curriculum, you will build your own personal website. The purpose is for you to build something that you can share with potential employers, friends, and members of the community. The personal website should be professional and true to who you. Through these websites, Jack and I will learn about your interests and backgrounds so that we can create curriculum that is responsive to your interests.

	<h3>Resources</h3>
	<p>Between sessions, we encourage you to continue learning. If you come across a helpful resource, add it to the shared resources tab on this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rXuxre7-hY498tjmCGNHuBf044cf41342UnxWcXRNBs/edit#gid=806688903" target="_blank">Google sheet</a>. During the online sessions, anyone who adds the resource can talk others through it and why they found it helpful. Learning through online resources is one of the most valuable sills you can develop as a programmer. </p>
