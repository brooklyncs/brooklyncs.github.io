	<h3>Course Description</h3>

	<p>The curriculum for this course is flexible. Jack and I intend to be responsive to the programming interests and desires of the participants. To address these needs, Jack and I will make an effort to understand about people's  jobs, career aspirations, and hobbies. </p>

	<p>The curriculum begins with participants building their own personal website. The purpose is for participants to build something that they can share with potential employers, friends, and members of the community. The personal website should strike a professional tone and be true to the person. Through these websites, Jack and I will learn about people's interests and backgrounds so that we can create curriculum that is responsive to your interests.
